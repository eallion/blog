It explores the idea that fate has been playing with them, bringing them closer but also pushing them further apart. The author reflects on possible moments in their lives where they could have crossed paths, but ultimately concludes that every beginning is just a continuation and that destiny is always unfolding.</description></item></channel></rss>
